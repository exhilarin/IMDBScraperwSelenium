# 🎬 IMDb Scraper with Selenium

A robust Python automation script designed to scrape movie, TV show, and rating data from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) using **Selenium WebDriver**. This project simulates real user behavior to navigate pages and extract structured data for analysis.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Browser Automation:** Uses Selenium to control a real Chrome browser instance.
* **Dynamic Content Handling:** Capable of scraping data that renders via JavaScript (unlike BeautifulSoup).
* **Data Extraction:** Targets specific elements like Movie Titles, Release Dates, Ratings, and Descriptions.
* **Scalable:** Can be modified to loop through multiple pages or lists (e.g., Top 250).

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **Python 3.7+**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Google Chrome Browser**: The script requires a standard Chrome installation.
3. **ChromeDriver**: A separate executable that allows Selenium to control Chrome.

   * *Note:* The version of ChromeDriver **must match** your installed Chrome version.
   * [Download ChromeDriver Here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

## 📥 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally in an isolated environment.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Download the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BatuhanbasSwe/IMDBScraperwSelenium.git
cd IMDBScraperwSelenium
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It is best practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.

On Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS / Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

(You will see `(venv)` appear at the start of your terminal line indicating it is active.)

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries inside your virtual environment:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

### 4. Driver Setup

Ensure the chromedriver.exe (Windows) or chromedriver (Mac/Linux) file is either:

* Placed directly inside this project folder.
* OR added to your system's PATH variables.

### 5. Setup MongoDB Connection (.env)

The project reads MongoDB credentials from a `.env` file to keep your password secure.

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<DB_USER>:<DB_PASS>@cluster0.kejl8qw.mongodb.net/?appName=Cluster0
```

Replace `<DB_USER>` and `<DB_PASS>` with your actual MongoDB username and password.

Example:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://oguzbatu2934_db_user:w9vjsbD855H1meI1@cluster0.kejl8qw.mongodb.net/?appName=Cluster0
```

2. Ensure `.gitignore` contains `.env` so your credentials are not pushed to GitHub.

3. The code will automatically read the `.env` and connect to MongoDB:

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from databasemanager import MongoDBManager

load_dotenv()  # Load .env
MY_URI = os.getenv("MONGO_URI")
db_manager = MongoDBManager(MY_URI, "IMDb_Archive", "Allcontent")
```

## 🚀 Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can run the scraper.

1. **Open the Script:** Open the main Python file (e.g., `main.py` or `scraper.py`) in your code editor.
2. **Configuration (Optional):** If the script targets a specific URL, you can modify the `url` variable inside the code to change the target page.
3. **Run the Script:** Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

## 🧠 How It Works (Logic)

1. **Initialization:** The script initializes the Selenium WebDriver and launches a Chrome window.
2. **Navigation:** It directs the browser to the specified IMDb URL.
3. **Element Location:** Using XPath or CSS Selectors, the script locates specific HTML elements (e.g., `<td class="titleColumn">` for movie titles).
4. **Extraction:** It iterates through the found elements, cleans the text data (removing newlines or extra spaces), and stores it in a list or dictionary.
5. **Output:** Finally, the data is printed to the console or saved to a file (CSV/TXT), and the browser closes automatically.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

* **SessionNotCreatedException:** ChromeDriver version not compatible with your Chrome Browser version. Update ChromeDriver.
* **NoSuchElementException:** IMDb may have updated their website structure (HTML/CSS classes). Inspect the page and update the XPath/CSS selectors in the code.
* **Browser closes immediately:** Usually happens if the script finishes execution or crashes. Run via terminal to see the error log.
